# bash-lib

DRY Principle is don't write same code again and again so, reducing redundancy.

**To Use**

```bash
# check whether command is existed or not
has_pkg <COMMAND>

# install package without foreground process
ins_pkg <PACKAGE-NAME>

# register package without foreground process
reg_pkg <PACKAGE-NAME>

# to remove package without foreground process
rm_pkg <PACKAGE-NAME>

# get me some randon values
random <STRING> <LIMIT>
```
